# üöÄ Project QOL Frontend

The frontend application for **Project QOL** (Quality of Life), a software development initiative aimed at enhancing the developer experience and overall quality of life for our team.

This project is a modern web application built with **Next.js** and bootstrapped using `create-next-app`.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js (React) and TypeScript for a robust and scalable application.
* **Optimized Performance**: Leverages Next.js features like automatic code splitting and Vercel's optimized font loading (Geist).
* **Intuitive Routing**: Uses the modern Next.js **App Router** for clear and organized page structure and routing logic.
* **Reusable Components**: Standardized UI components for rapid development and consistency.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository is organized to maintain clarity and separation of concerns, following standard Next.js conventions.

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`app/`** | Contains the **routing logic** for the application (the App Router). This is where you define your pages, layouts, and their respective routes. |
| **`components/`** | Houses **reusable UI components** (e.g., buttons, cards, navigation) that are used throughout the application. |
| **`hooks/`** | Stores **custom React Hooks** for encapsulating stateful logic and making it reusable across different components. |
| **`libs/`** | Intended for **utility functions**, helper libraries, constant data, and non-React specific logic. |
| **`public/`** | For static assets like images, fonts, and other files that need to be served directly. |
